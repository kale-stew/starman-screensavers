# Hack Your Mac: Upgrade Your Screensaver to Loops of [Starman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBr2kKAHN6M) Floating Through Space

Are you bored with the default photo reel screensavers that come standard to your Mac? Were you crazy excited about SpaceX’s [Falcon Heavy test launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c)? So was I. That's why I put this repo together.

## _Don’t Panic_ — It’s easy. There are only **5** steps!

1. Download the cool Starman videos I screenshot from the live feed (_RIP Live Feed, Feb 6 2018 — Feb 6 2018_) by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13byFXgQNlhNhgXE3xF0AGBREcg_196GG).

2. Download the package you need to actually set up the screensavers by visiting [this page](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/SaveHollywood/about.html) and hitting the big 'ol Download button in the upper righthand corner.
    - _Note:_  This package (`SaveHollywood`) is a module designed for any Mac running OS X 10.8 or later. This package will allow you to loop over videos (not just photos) in your screensaver theme.

3. Upon hitting Download, you’ll get a `.dmg` file — simply double click to mount the disk image. Open that disc up and double click on the `SaveHollywood.saver` icon. This will install the module and take you to the appropriate System Preferences window.

4. Now that you’re in System Preferences, click on `Desktop & Screen Saver`, scroll down to the bottom of listed themes in the lefthand column until you see SaveHollywood as an option.

5. Finally, with the SaveHollywood theme selected, click on `Screen Saver Options…` and import all 3 videos by clicking the `+` in the upper section. These are the settings I prefer with this suite of videos:
